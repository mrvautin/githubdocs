### Using a Github repository

`Githubdocs` reads the files from the remote repository, it then polls the repository intermittently for changes and updates the website automatically.

The docs menu and files are built using files from the Github repository set in the config file. Files should have the title of the doc in a single markdown hash/# (HTML = H1) tag in the file. This is used to build the slug of the doc and the menu title.
